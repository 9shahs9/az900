= Azure compute services.

== [.underline]#Overview# 

=== Virtual machines

* Full control of OS and environment.
* IaaS solution.

=== Virtual machine Scale sets

* Deploy and scale Identical VMs.
    e.g. Cluster of VMs running Kafka.

=== Containers and Kubernetes

* Used to deploy container applications.

=== App Services

* Quickly build, deploy and scale applications
    ** Web applications
    ** Mobile applications
    ** API applications.
* PaaS offering.
* Meet Performance, Scalability, Security and Compliance requirements.

=== Functions

* Only interested in the code running and not worried about underlying platform or infrastructure.
* Work done in response to Event e.g.
    ** RESTful API.
    ** Timer
    ** Message from another Azure service.


== Virtual Machines

=== [.underline]#VM#

* No need of Physical Infrastructure
* You need to configure, update and maintain the Software that runs on VMs.
* VM is created from a template [template contains OS + S/ws that run on it.]

=== [.underline]#VM Scale Set#

* Group of identical and *Load balanced* VMs.
* Centrally configure, update and manage large number of VMs.
* Scale based on either demand or schedule.
* Ideal to build large scale worksets for Compute, BigData or Container workloads.


=== [.underline]#Azure Batch#

* Enables large scale parallel and High Performance Compute jobs.
* Can scale to tens, hundreds or thousands of VMs.
* Azure Batch does the following
    ** Starts a pool of compute VMs for you.
    ** Installs applications and staging data.
    ** Runs jobs with as many tasks as you have.
    ** Identifies failures.
    ** Requeues work.
    ** Scales down the pool as work completes.
* Common application workloads include 
    ** image and video rendering, 
    ** media transcoding, 
    ** engineering simulations, 
    ** Monte Carlo simulations, and 
    ** software test execution

== Containers

Two solutions exists for Managing the containers in Azure. 

=== [.underline]#Azure Container Instances#

* Upload your container.
* ACI runs the container with scalability.

=== [.underline]#Azure Kubernetes Services#

* Automating, Managing and Interacting with large no.of containers is Orchestration.
* AKS is complete orchestration service.

== Azure App services

Build the following types of applications.
Deploy and scale as required by load demand.

* WebApps.
* API Apps.
* WebJobs
* Mobile Apps.


== Azure Functions

* Triggers define how function is invoked.
* Bindings provide a declarative way to connect to services from within the code
