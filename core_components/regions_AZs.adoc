== [.underline]#Availability Zones#

* AZ is collection of DCs
* An AZ has independent Power, Network and Cooling
* Not every region has support for Availability Zones.
* If a Region has AZs then it would have 3 or more AZs in it.
* Zonal Services : Azure doesn't replicate these services automatically.
* Zone Redundant Services : Azure Platform replicates automatically across zones for availability. e.g. Storage, SQL Databases, etc.


== [.underline]#Azure Region Pairs#

* Each Region is always paired with another region in same Geography.
* Minimum distance between regions in Region pair is atleast (>=) 300 miles.
